# Hui-Ting Cai    (蔡慧婷)

🤗 Welcome to my website!

I am a graduate student from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I earned my 🎓Master's degree in Psychology . Currently, I am engaged as a full-time researcher at 🏥Shanghai Xuhui Mental Health Center in China (expected to finish in *June 2026*).

Driven by a strong desire to further my research training, I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position in **Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience**. With over three years of experience in organizing and conducting clinical research, I have honed my skills in collecting and analyzing human electro-neurophysiological signals, including scalp EEG and stereo EEG. Furthermore, I possess expertise in integrating these techniques with non-invasive brain stimulation methods such as TMS, tDCS, and tACS. More information can be found at my <u>[Experiences](/experiences)</u> and <u>[Publications](/publications)</u> pages.

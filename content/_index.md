# Welcome to my website! 🤗 


I hold a Master's in Psychology from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and currently work as a full-time researcher at Shanghai Xuhui Mental Health Center.

I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position in <strong>Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience</strong>. With over three years of clinical research experience, I specialize in <strong>human electrophysiology</strong> (scalp EEG & stereo-EEG) and its integration with <strong>non-invasive brain stimulation</strong> (TMS, tDCS, tACS). I am open to mastering new tools and approaches in my future studies.

Explore my <a href="/experiences">Experiences</a> and <a href="/publications">Publications</a> for more details.
